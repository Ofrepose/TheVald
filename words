Most Workout apps tell you what to do in your workout. I am developing one that makes use of your current workout routine. Easily setup your favorite exercises, connect to your Spotify playlist, and go! This app automatically counts down your rest times and give you an uninterrupted workout. It also saves and tracks your workouts; giving you the stats you need and showing how you've progressed over time.
